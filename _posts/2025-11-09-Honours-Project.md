### Overview
Focused on improving data pre-processing for a GAN-based Minecraft 2D map generator. Conducted extensive research on the history and current state of AI in games, with a focus on deep learning techniques as part of the dissertation.

### My role
- C++ Programmer
- Responsibilities: reverse-engineer large codebase (C++ Multi-Threaded renderer for Minecraft maps: [**Mapcrafter**](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter))

### What I built
- Implemented a data pre-processing pipeline in Python (color correction and normalization) to prepare training data for the GAN
- Used SSH (PuTTY) to run and monitor training and validation on remote machines
- Created documentation and experiment reports to support the dissertation

### Technical highlights
- Engine / Framework: Custom C++
- Languages: C++, Python

### Results / Metrics
- Developed stronger project organisation and long-term planning skills
- Improved time management to meet bi-weekly deadlines with my supervisor (Ruth Falconer)
- Presented hypothesis, experiments, and results to an assessment panel
