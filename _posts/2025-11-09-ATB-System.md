### Overview
Action Time Battle System developed using Blueprints in C++. Started as a group project contribution, the project developed as a standalone system that can be easily integrate inside a pre-existing project. Using State Trees for Combat flow logic and UMG Widgets for player interaction this system takes inspiration from titles such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

- State Tree driven Combat System 
- Active Time Gauge mechanic to Queue up Combatants
